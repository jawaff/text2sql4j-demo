We need to finish our validator, top priority:
- The parsing is waaayyy too slow because we keep decoding things that have already been decoded. We need to maintain a cache.
  The top_token is the next value and input_ids[-1] is the last value that was selected for this beam. We can be sure that
  input_ids[:-1] are always going to be there. input_ids[-1] + top_token will be the working buffer.
- Another thing about slowness, we need to possibly lessen the amount of times we run the parse check and we need to
  fail as early as possible. Obvious failure tokens will be ignored for some reason and won't show up in the results
  of the query! We should check these tokens against what is expected, if possible.


- Where possible, we need to run full parsing checks. The partial parsing is giving us too many false positives.
- When finding a table column we need to check it against our records to see if it exists.
- When comparing a column with another we need to check that the tyinput_ids[-1]pe is correct!
